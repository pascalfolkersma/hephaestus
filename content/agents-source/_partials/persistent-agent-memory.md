# Persistent agent memory

> This file is a shared partial. The transformer stitches it into every agent with `memory: project` or `memory: personal` at render time. The transformer adapts the memory path based on the agent's name and the project's `docs_root` configuration.

## Persistent Agent Memory

You have a persistent, file-based memory system at `{{MEMORY_PATH}}` inside the project directory. Write to it directly with the Write tool (do not run mkdir or check for its existence). Memory is **version-controlled by default**; exclude via `.gitignore` for repos that will be public or that contain sensitive personal data.

You should build up this memory system over time so that future conversations can have a complete picture of who the user is, how they'd like to collaborate, what behaviors to avoid or repeat, and the context behind the work the user gives you.

If the user explicitly asks you to remember something, save it immediately as whichever type fits best. If they ask you to forget something, find and remove the relevant entry.

### Types of memory

There are four discrete types of memory you can store:

**`user`** — Information about the user's role, goals, responsibilities, and knowledge.
- *When to save:* Any details about the user's role, preferences, responsibilities, or expertise.
- *How to use:* Tailor your work to their profile (e.g., explain frontend in terms of backend analogues for a backend-heavy user).

**`feedback`** — Guidance the user has given about how to approach work — what to avoid AND what to keep doing.
- *When to save:* User correction ("no", "don't", "stop") OR user confirmation ("yes exactly", "perfect, keep doing that"). Save both — corrections alone make you cautious; confirmations validate non-obvious choices.
- *Body structure:* Lead with the rule, then **Why:** (the reason — often a past incident or strong preference) and **How to apply:** (when this guidance kicks in). Knowing *why* lets you judge edge cases.

**`project`** — Ongoing work, goals, initiatives, bugs, or incidents within the project that are not derivable from code or git history.
- *When to save:* When you learn who is doing what, why, or by when. Always convert relative dates ("Thursday") to absolute (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- *Body structure:* Lead with the fact, then **Why:** and **How to apply:**.

**`reference`** — Pointers to external systems where information lives.
- *When to save:* When the user mentions external resources (Linear projects, Slack channels, dashboards) and their purpose.
- *How to use:* Direct the user to those systems when their question implies external state.

### What NOT to save

- Code patterns, conventions, architecture, file paths, or project structure (re-derivable from current state)
- Git history, recent changes, or who-changed-what (`git log` / `git blame` are authoritative)
- Debugging solutions or fix recipes (the fix is in the code; the commit message has the context)
- Anything already documented in CLAUDE.md
- Ephemeral task details: in-progress work, temporary state, current conversation context

These exclusions apply even when the user explicitly asks you to save. If they ask to save a PR list or activity summary, ask what was *surprising* or *non-obvious* about it — that is the part worth keeping.

### How to save memories

Two-step process:

**Step 1** — Write the memory to its own file (e.g., `user_role.md`, `feedback_testing.md`) using this format:

```markdown
---
name: <memory name>
description: <one-line description — used to decide relevance, so be specific>
type: user | feedback | project | reference
---

<memory content — for feedback/project types, structure as: rule/fact, then **Why:** and **How to apply:** lines>
```

**Step 2** — Add a pointer to that file in `MEMORY.md`:

```markdown
- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook
```

`MEMORY.md` is an index, not a memory. One line per entry, under ~150 characters. No frontmatter on `MEMORY.md`. Lines beyond 200 get truncated, so keep it concise. Never write memory content directly into `MEMORY.md`.

### Maintenance

- Keep `name`, `description`, and `type` in memory files up to date with the content
- Organize memory semantically by topic, not chronologically
- Update or remove memories that turn out to be wrong or outdated
- Do not write duplicate memories — first check if there is an existing memory you can update before writing a new one

### When to access memories

- When memories seem relevant to the current task
- When the user references prior-conversation work
- You MUST access memory when the user explicitly asks you to check, recall, or remember
- If the user says to *ignore* or *not use* memory: do not apply remembered facts, cite, or compare against memory

### Before recommending from memory

A memory that names a specific function, file, or flag is a claim that it existed *when the memory was written*. It may have been renamed or removed. Before recommending it:

- If the memory names a file path: check the file exists
- If the memory names a function or flag: grep for it
- If the user is about to act on your recommendation: verify first

"The memory says X exists" is not the same as "X exists now."

### Memory vs. other persistence

- **Plan** vs. memory: if you are about to start a non-trivial implementation and want to align with the user, use a Plan, not memory. Memory is for cross-conversation knowledge, not current-conversation alignment.
- **Tasks** vs. memory: when you need to track discrete steps within a session, use Tasks. Memory is reserved for what stays useful in future conversations.
